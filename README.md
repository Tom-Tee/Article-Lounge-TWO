I wanted to take a live website with an attractive design and copy it to the best of my ability, while putting my spin on it. The page includes a horizontal scroll as well as some Javascript usage on the button selector. My biggest challenge was creating the “Journal” hover effect on the navbar which I found very unique. The page is fully responsive.
